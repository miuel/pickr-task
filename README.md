### What is this repository for? ###

* Pickr Task
* Version 1.0.0
* Complete a technical task for them:

* Write a React Native application that consists of a single view, with 3 boxes in it. On startup, in each box, a random single * * digit 
* number should appear.

* Below the boxes there should be a button with the text "Generate" in it. When a user clicks the "Generate" button, each box will 
* show a new random digit. The application should make use of a redux store for storing its state.

* At the bottom of the view there should be another button, "Show Log". When a user clicks the "Show Log" button, a pop up box 
* should appear, showing a log of all of the generated numbers so far, with 3 numbers in each line. The log of generated numbers * should not be saved in the redux store.

* Please include build and run instructions for both Android and iOS.
